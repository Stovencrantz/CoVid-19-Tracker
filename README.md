This page is meant to give the user access to information about the current pandemic to anyone who is looking for information. It's more directly targeted at U.S. Citizens as our page can bring the user various information about every state through a simple button click. We also post world data to keep the user informed of cases abroad. On the navbar we have links to services that can help the user to even better understand how to keep themselves and their loved ones safe during these times.
